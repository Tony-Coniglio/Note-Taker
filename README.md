# Note-Taker

The Note Taker app allows users to write and store notes. The notes will constist of both a title and body section.

## Summary

In this project I worked on the routes on the back end given the provided starter code for the front end of the app. While there were only a few routes that need to be written for the Note-Taker app, I learned the proper way to write routes and connect front and back ends of the application. 

## UUID

UUID was used to create unique ids for each note.

## Acknowledgements

My tutor helped me debug the routes and review some problem areas when coming up with routes.
